    Below you see a basic-stack element containing a landscape image and a
    portrait image. The basic-stack has a border applied so you can see the
    element's bounds. As you resize (or rotate) the window, note that the
    basic-stack updates its size to be the maximium height and width of its two
    children. Significantly, the source does not require that the heights of
    those child elements be pre-calculated at design time and fixed in CSS.
  </p>

        <img src="../basic-shared/resources/images/image1.jpg">
        <img src="../basic-shared/resources/images/image6.jpg">
  </basic-stack>
  <p>
    Any elements below the basic-stack will remain in place regardless of
    which of its children are visible.
