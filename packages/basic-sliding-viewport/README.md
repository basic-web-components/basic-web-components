<a name="SlidingViewport"></a>

## SlidingViewport ‚áê <code>ElementBase</code>
Presents list items in a viewport such that only a single item is visible at
a time.

Navigating between items will be represented with a horizontal visual
sliding effect. For more complex visual effects, see
[basic-animation-stage](../basic-animation-stage), which takes advantage of
the Web Animations API.

This component handles the rendering responsibilities for the basic-carousel
component.

This component currently requires that you explicitly apply a size to it.
