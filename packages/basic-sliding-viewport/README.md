## SlidingViewport ‚áê <code>ElementBase</code>
Presents list items in a viewport such that only a single item is visible at
a time.

Navigating between items will be represented with a horizontal visual
sliding effect.

This component handles the rendering responsibilities for the basic-carousel

### slidingViewport.position : <code>number</code>
The fractional position of the element's moving surface while it is being
moved (dragged/scrolled/etc.).

This is expressed as a fraction of the element's width. If the value is
positive, the surface is being moved to the left; if negative, the surface
is being moved to the right. E.g., a value of 0.5 indicates the surface has
moved half the element's width to the left.

  **Kind**: instance property of <code>[SlidingViewport](#SlidingViewport)</code>
