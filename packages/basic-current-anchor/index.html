  <p>
    The links on this page highlight themselves as appropriate. They will appear
    current (bold) when the current page address matches their link destination.
    As an example, the links below navigate to anchors within the page. As you
    navigate (by clicking, editing the address bar, going back/forward), the
    links will update their own current state.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <basic-current-anchor href="#one">One</basic-current-anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-current-anchor href="#two">Two</basic-current-anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-current-anchor href="#three">Three</basic-current-anchor>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A link of this type can also represent an area within a site, not just a
    single page. Such a link will be marked as current whenever the user is at a
    destination at or below the point in the navigational hierarchy indicated
    by the link's destination.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <basic-current-anchor href="./">Page link</basic-current-anchor>.
      The link only appears current when the current page address matches the
      link destination. In this demo, it will only appear current if there is
      no "#" hash anchor in the address bar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <basic-current-anchor href="./" area-link='true'>Area link</basic-current-anchor>.
      The link goes to the same destination as the page link above, but appears
      current whenever the current page address matches the prefix indicated by
      the link destination. In this demo, it will always show as current.
    </li>
  </ul>
