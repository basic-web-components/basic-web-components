/**
 * @class ObserveContentChanges
 * @classdesc Wires up mutation observers to report any changes in a component's
 * content (direct children, or nodes distributed to slots).
 *
 * For the time being, this can only support a single level of distributed
 * content. That is, if a component contains a slot, and the set of nodes
 * directly assigned to that slot changes, then this mixin will detect the
 * change. However, this mixin does not yet detect changes in reprojected
 * nodes. If a component's host places a slot as a child of the component
 * instance, nodes assigned to the outer host will be assigned to the host's
 * slot, then reassigned to the slot element inside the component. Changes in
 * such reprojected nodes will not (yet) be detected by this mixin.
 *
 * For comparison, see Polymer's observeNodes API, which does solve the problem
 * of tracking changes in reprojected content.
