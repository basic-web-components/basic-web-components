   * Mixin which wires up mutation observers to report any changes in a
   * component's content (direct children, or nodes distributed to slots).
   *
   * For the time being, this can only support a single level of distributed
   * content. That is, if a component contains a slot, and the set of nodes
   * directly assigned to that slot changes, then this mixin will detect the
   * change. However, this mixin does not yet detect changes in reprojected
   * nodes. If a component's host places a slot as a child of the component
   * instance, nodes assigned to the outer host will be assigned to the host's
   * slot, then reassigned to the slot element inside the component. Changes in
   * such reprojected nodes will not (yet) be detected by this mixin.
   *
   * For comparison, see Polymer's observeNodes API, which does solve the
   * problem of tracking changes in reprojected content.
   *
   * Note: The web platform team creating the specifications for web components
   * plan to request that a new type of MutationObserver option be defined that
   * lets a component monitor changes in distributed children. This mixin will
   * be updated to take advantage of that MutationObserver option when that
   * becomes available.
