  /**
   * Mixin to create references to elements in a component's Shadow DOM subtree.
   *
   * This adds a member on the component called `this.$` that can be used to
   * reference shadow elements with IDs. E.g., if component's shadow contains an
   * element `<button id="foo">`, then this mixin will create a member
   * `this.$.foo` that points to that button.
   *
   * Such references simplify a component's access to its own elements. In
   * exchange, this mixin trades off a one-time cost of querying all elements in
   * the shadow tree instead of paying an ongoing cost to query for an element
   * each time the component wants to inspect or manipulate it.
   *
   * This mixin expects the component to define a Shadow DOM subtree. You can
   * create that tree yourself, or make use of
   * [ShadowTemplateMixin](ShadowTemplateMixin.md).
   *
   * This mixin is inspired by Polymer's [automatic
   * node finding](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/local-dom.html#node-finding)
   * feature.
