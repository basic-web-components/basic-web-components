  /**
   * Mixin which manages the keydown handling for a component.
   *
   * This mixin handles several keyboard-related features.
   *
   * First, it wires up a single keydown event handler that can be shared by
   * multiple mixins on a component. The event handler will invoke a `keydown`
   * method with the event object, and any mixin along the prototype chain that
   * wants to handle that method can do so.
   *
   * If a mixin wants to indicate that keyboard event has been handled, and that
   * other mixins should *not* handle it, the mixin's `keydown` handler should
   * return a value of true. The convention that seems to work well is that a
   * mixin should see if it wants to handle the event and, if not, then ask the
   * superclass to see if it wants to handle the event. This has the effect of
   * giving the mixin that was applied last the first chance at handling a
   * keyboard event.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     keydown(event) {
   *       let handled;
   *       switch (event.keyCode) {
   *         // Handle the keys you want, setting handled = true if appropriate.
   *       }
   *       // Prefer mixin result if it's defined, otherwise use base result.
   *       return handled || (super.keydown && super.keydown(event));
   *     }
   *
   * A second feature provided by this mixin is that it implicitly makes the
   * component a tab stop if it isn't already, by setting `tabIndex` to 0. This
   * has the effect of adding the component to the tab order in document order.
   *
   * Finally, this mixin is designed to work with the optional
   * [Collective](Collective.md) class via a mixin like
   * [TargetInCollective](TargetInCollective.md). This allows a set of related
   * component instances to cooperatively handle the keyboard. See the
   * Collective class for details.
