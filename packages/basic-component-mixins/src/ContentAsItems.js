   * Mixin which maps content semantics (elements) to list item semantics.
   *
   * Items differ from element contents in several ways:
   *
   * * They are often referenced via index.
   * * They may have a selection state.
   * * It's common to do work to initialize the appearance or state of a new
   *   item.
   * * Auxiliary invisible child elements are filtered out and not counted as
   *   items. Auxiliary elements include link, script, style, and template
   *   elements. This filtering ensures that those auxiliary elements can be
   *   used in markup inside of a list without being treated as list items.
   *
   * This mixin expects a component to provide a `content` property returning a
   * raw set of elements. You can provide that yourself, or use the
   * [DistributedChildrenAsContent](DistributedChildrenAsContent.md) mixin.
   *
   * The most commonly referenced property defined by this mixin is the `items`
   * property. To avoid having to do work each time that property is requested,
   * this mixin supports an optimized mode. If you invoke the `contentChanged`
   * method when the set of items changes, the mixin concludes that you'll take
   * care of notifying it of future changes, and turns on the optimization. With
   * that on, the mixin saves a reference to the computed set of items, and will
   * return that immediately on subsequent calls to the `items` property. If you
   * use this mixin in conjunction with the
   * [ObserveContentChanges](ObserveContentChanges.md) mixin, the
   * `contentChanged` method will be invoked for you when the element's children
   * change, turning on the optimization automatically.
