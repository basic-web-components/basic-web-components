/*

/**
 * Dampen a selection that goes past the beginning or end of a list. This is
 * generally used to produce a visual effect of tension as the user tries to
 * go further in a direction that has no more items.
 *
 * Example: suppose `itemCount` is 5, indicating a list of 5 items. The index of
 * the last item is 4. If the `selection` parameter is 4.5, the user is trying
 * to go past this last item. When a damping function is applied, the resulting
 * value will be less than 4.5 (the actual value will be 4.25). When this
 * selection state is rendered, the user will see that, each unit distance the
 * drag travels has less and less visible effect. This is perceived as tension.
 *
 * @param {number} selection - A real number indicating a selection position
 * @param {number} itemCount - An integer for the number of items in the list
 * @returns {number} A real number representing the damped selection value.
