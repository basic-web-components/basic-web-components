  /**
   * Mixin that defines the target of a component — the element the component is
   * managing or somehow responsible for — as its first child.
   *
   * Some components serve to decorate or modify other elements. A common
   * pattern is to have one component wrap another, and have the outer, parent
   * component implicitly modify the child. This mixin facilitates this by
   * implicitly taking an element's first child as its "target".
   *
   * Example:
   *
   *     <outer-element>
   *       <inner-element></inner-element>
   *     </outer-element>
   *
   * If `outer-element` uses this mixin, then its `target` property will be
   * set to point to the `inner-element`, because that is its first child.
   *
   * This mixin expects a `content` property that returns the element's content.
   * You can implement that yourself, or use the
   * [DistributedChildrenAsContent](DistributedChildrenAsContent.md) mixin.
   *
   * This mixin can be combined with the
   * [TargetInCollective](TargetInCollective.md) mixin to have a component
   * participate in collective keyboard handling.
