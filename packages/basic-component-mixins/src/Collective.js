/**
 * A group of elements that have been associated for the purpose of
 * accomplishing some collective behavior, e.g., keyboard handling.
 *
 * There are certain components that want to cooperatively handle the keyboard.
 * For example, the basic-arrow-selection and basic-page-dots components are
 * optional components that can augment the appearance and behavior of an inner
 * basic-carousel, adding arrow buttons and dot buttons, respectively. When
 * these components are nested together, they form an implicit unit called a
 * *collective*:
 *
 *     <basic-arrow-selection>
 *       <basic-page-dots>
 *         <basic-carousel>
 *           ... images, etc. ...
 *         </basic-carousel>
 *       </basic-page-dots>
 *     </basic-arrow-selection>
 *
 * In this configuration, the three components will all have a `this.collective`
 * reference that refers to a shared instance of the `Collective` class.
 *
 * The [Keyboard](Keyboard.md) mixin they use is sensitive to the presence of
 * the collective. Among other things, it will ensure that only the outermost
 * element above — the basic-arrow-selection — will be a tab stop that can
 * receive the keyboard focus. This lets the user perceive the component
 * arrangement above as a single unit. The Keyboard mixin will also give each
 * element in the collective a chance to process any keyboard events. So, even
 * though the basic-arrow-selection element will have the focus, the standard
 * keyboard navigation provided by basic-carousel will continue to work.
 *
 * The [SelectionAriaActive](SelectionAriaActive.md) mixin also respects
 * collectives when using the `aria-activedescendant` and `role` attributes.
 * Those will be applied to the outermost element (basic-arrow-selection, above)
 * so that ARIA can correctly understand the arrangement of the elements.
 *
 * You can put elements into collectives yourself, or you can use the
 * [TargetInCollective](TargetInCollective.md) mixin.
