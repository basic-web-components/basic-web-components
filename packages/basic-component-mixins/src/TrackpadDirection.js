   * Mixin which maps a horizontal trackpad swipe gestures (or horizontal mouse

   *
   * You can use this mixin with a mixin like
   * [DirectionSelection](DirectionSelection.md) to let the user change the
   * selection with the trackpad or mouse wheel.
   *
   * To respond to the trackpad, we can listen to the DOM's "wheel" events.
   * These events are fired as the user drags their fingers across a trackpad.
   * Unfortunately, browsers are missing a critical event — there is no event
   * when the user *stops* a gestured on the trackpad or mouse wheel.
   *
   * To make things worse, the mainstream browsers continue to generate fake
   * wheel events even after the user has stopped dragging their fingers. These
   * fake events simulate the user gradually slowing down the drag until they
   * come to a smooth stop. In some contexts, these fake wheel events might be
   * helpful, but in trying to supply typical trackpad swipe navigation, these
   * fake events get in the way.
   *
   * This component uses heuristics to work around these problems, but the
   * complex nature of the problem make it extremely difficult to achieve the
   * same degree of trackpad responsiveness possible with native applications.
