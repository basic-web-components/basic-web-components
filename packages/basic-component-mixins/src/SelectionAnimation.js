  /**
   * Mixin which uses animation to show transitions between selection states.
   *
   * This mixin can be used by components that want to provide visible
   * animations when changing the selection. For example, a carousel component
   * may want to define a sliding animation effect shown when moving between
   * items.
   *
   * The animation is defined by a `selectionAnimationKeyframes` property; see
   * that property for details on how to define these keyframes. This animation
   * will be used in two ways. First, when moving strictly between items, the
   * animation will play smoothly to show the selection changing. Second, the
   * animation can be used to render the selection at a fixed point in the
   * transition between states. E.g., if the user pauses halfway through
   * dragging an element using the [SwipeDirection](SwipeDirection.md) or
   * [TrackpadDirection](TrackpadDirection.md) mixins, then the selection
   * animation will be shown at the point exactly halfway through.
   *
   * This mixin expects a component to provide an `items` array of all elements
   * in the list, which can be provided via the
   * [ContentAsItems](ContentAsItems.md) mixin. This mixin also expects
   * `selectedIndex` and `selectedItem` properties, which can be provided via
   * the [ItemsSelection](ItemsSelection.md) mixin.
   *
   * This mixin supports a `selectionWraps` property. When true, the user can
   * navigate forward from the last item in the list and wrap around to the
   * first item, or navigate backward from the first item and wrap around to the
   * last item.
   *
   * This mixin uses the Web Animations API. For use on browsers which
   * do not support that API natively, you will need to load the
   * [Web Animations polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js).
