   * Mixin which defines helpers for accessing a component's distributed
   * children as a flattened array or string.
   *
   * The standard DOM API provides several ways of accessing child content:
   * `children`, `childNodes`, and `textContent`. None of these functions are
   * Shadow DOM aware. This mixin defines variations of those functions that
   * *are* Shadow DOM aware.
   *
   * Example: you create a component `<count-children>` that displays a number
   * equal to the number of children placed inside that component. If someone
   * instantiates your component like:
   *
   *     <count-children>
   *       <div></div>
   *       <div></div>
   *       <div></div>
   *     </count-children>
   *
   * Then the component should show "3", because there are three children. To
   * calculate the number of children, the component can just calculate
   * `this.children.length`. However, suppose someone instantiates your
   * component inside one of their own components, and puts a `<slot>` element
   * inside your component:
   *
   *     <count-children>
   *       <slot></slot>
   *     </count-children>
   *
   * If your component only looks at `this.children`, it will always see exactly
   * one child — the `<slot>` element. But the user looking at the page will
   * *see* any nodes distributed to that slot. To match what the user sees, your
   * component should expand any `<slot>` elements it contains.
   *
   * That is the problem this mixin solves. After applying this mixin, your
   * component code has access to `this.distributedChildren`, whose `length`
   * will return the total number of all children distributed to your component
   * in the composed tree.
   *
   * Note: The latest Custom Elements API design calls for a new function,
   * `getAssignedNodes` that takes an optional `deep` parameter, that will solve
   * this problem at the API level.
