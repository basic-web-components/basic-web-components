## DistributedChildrenAsContent
Mixin which defines a component's content as its children, expanding any
nodes distributed to the component's slots.

This mixin is intended for use with the
[DistributedChildren](DistributedChildren.md) mixin. See that mixin for a
discussion of how that works. This DistributedChildrenAsContent mixin
provides an easy way of defining the "content" of a component as the
component's distributed children. That in turn lets mixins like
[ContentAsItems](ContentAsItems.md) manipulate the children as list items.
