<a name="DirectionSelection"></a>

## DirectionSelection
Mixin which maps direction semantics (goLeft, goRight, etc.) to selection
semantics (selectPrevious, selectNext, etc.).

This mixin can be used in conjunction with
[KeyboardDirectionMixin](KeyboardDirectionMixin.md) (which maps keyboard
events to directions) and a mixin that handles selection like
[SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin.md).
