<a name="ContentFirstChildTarget"></a>
## ContentFirstChildTarget
Mixin that defines the target of a component — the element the component is
managing or somehow responsible for — as its first child.

Some components serve to decorate or modify other elements. A common
pattern is to have one component wrap another, and have the outer, parent
component implicitly modify the child. This mixin facilitates this by
implicitly taking an element's first child as its "target".

Example:

    <outer-element>
      <inner-element></inner-element>
    </outer-element>

If `outer-element` uses this mixin, then its `target` property will be
set to point to the `inner-element`, because that is its first child.

This mixin expects a `content` property that returns the element's content.
You can implement that yourself, or use the
[DistributedChildrenAsContent](DistributedChildrenAsContent.md) mixin.

This mixin can be combined with the
[TargetInCollective](TargetInCollective.md) mixin to have a component
participate in collective keyboard handling.
