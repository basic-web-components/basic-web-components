<a name="DirectionSelection"></a>
## DirectionSelection
Mixin which maps direction semantics (goLeft, goRight, etc.) to selection
semantics (selectPrevious, selectNext, etc.).

This mixin can be used in conjunction with the
[KeyboardDirection](KeyboardDirection.md) mixin (which maps keyboard events
to directions) and a mixin that handles selection like
[ItemsSelection](ItemsSelection.md).
