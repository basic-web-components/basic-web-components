/**
 * Lets the user navigate laterally through a sequence of child elements.
 *
 * basic-carousel is an implementation of the carousel user interface pattern,
 * commonly used for navigating between images, pages, and other elements. This
 * pattern presents the user with a linear sequence of elements, only one of
 * which is shown at a time. The user can navigate to the next/previous element
 * with a variety of input methods.
 *
 * [Live demo](http://basicwebcomponents.org/basic-web-components/packages/basic-carousel/)
 *
 * The above demo is a plain carousel. It's often combined, however, with
 * mixins like
 * [ArrowSelectionMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/ArrowSelectionMixin.md),
 * [PageDotsMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/PageDotsMixin.md),
 * [TimerSelectionMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/TimerSelectionMixin.md).
 * For example, you can view a
 * [demo with arrows and page dots](http://basicwebcomponents.org/basic-web-components/packages/demos/carousel-with-arrows-and-dots.html).
 * See the specific mixins for other carousel demos.
 *
 * basic-carousel uses its children as the elements the user will navigate
 * through. In a typical use, a basic-carousel can be used to navigate between a
 * sequence of images:
 *
 *     <basic-carousel>
 *       <img src="image1.jpg">
 *       <img src="image2.jpg">
 *       <img src="image3.jpg">
 *     </basic-carousel>
 *
 * The child elements can be of any type — they are not restricted to images.
 *
 * This component attempts to meet the [Gold Standard for web components]
 * (https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki) so that it is generally
 * as flexible and robust as standard HTML elements. For example, it meets the
 * "Content Changes" criteria: the carousel will adapt to new child elements
 * added or removed at runtime.
 *
 * Currently, this component does not meet the Gold Standard criteria "Size to
 * Content". As a result, for the time being, **you must manually set a size on
 * this component**. Two approaches are to: 1) stretch the component across
 * whatever surface it is contained within, or 2) set it to be larger than the
 * largest child element you want to display. The former approach is more
 * common, and can be achieved with CSS styling such as:
 *
 *     html {
 *       height: 100%;
 *     }
 *
 *     body {
 *       display: -webkit-flex;
 *       display: flex;
 *       height: 100%;
 *       margin: 0;
 *     }
 *
 *     basic-carousel {
 *       -webkit-flex: 1;
 *       flex: 1;
 *     }
 *
 * The standard basic-carousel component supports navigation via the following
 * input methods:
 *
 * * Keyboard. When the carousel has focus, the user can press Left, Right,
 *   Home, or End. These navigate to the expected element.
 * * Touch. On mobile and other touch-enabled devices, the user can drag left or
 *   right.
 * * Trackpad. The user can swipe left or right on a trackpad to navigate.
 *
 * Because carousels are used in a wide variety of circumstances, by default
 * basic-carousel provides a minimal appearance and no separately interactive
 * elements such as arrow buttons on the side or dots along the bottom. Those
 * elements can be added by wrapping a Carousel in optional mixins:
 *
 * * [ArrowSelectionMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/ArrowSelectionMixin.md).
 *   Adds prominent left and right arrow buttons on the side of the carousel.
 * * [PageDotsMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/PageDotsMixin.md).
 *   Adds a series of small dots below the carousel to indicate the user's
 *   current position in the sequence.
 * * [TimerSelectionMixin](../basic-component-mixins/docs/TimerSelectionMixin.md).
 *   Advances to the next item on a timer.
 * * [TabStripMixin](../basic-tab-strip).
 *   Adds a strip of traditional tab buttons.
 *
 * See those components for more details, but in general you can construct a
 * common carousel with both arrow buttons and dots like so:
 *
 *     class MyCarousel extends
 *         ArrowSelectionMixin(PageDotsMixin(Carousel)) {}
 *     customElements.define('my-carousel', MyCarousel);
 *
 * For universal access, basic-carousel automatically adds a variety of
 * [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) properties to itself and to child
 * elements. This helps users navigate the sequence of elements in the carousel
 * using assistive technologies.
